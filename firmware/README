* ./boot: *start.elf, bootcode.bin and loader.bin are the GPU firmware and 
  bootloaders. Their licence is described in 'LICENCE.broadcom'. The 
  kernel.img files are builds of the Linux kernel, released under the GPL (see 
  COPYING.linux)
* ./debug: pre-build modules for the kernel_debug.img
* ./extra: System.map files for the provided kernel builds
* ./hardfp: userspace VideoCoreIV libraries built for the armv6 hardfp ABI
* ./modules: pre-built modules for kernel.img
* ./opt/vc: includes userspace libraries for the VideCoreIV (EGL/GLES/OpenVG 
   etc). See ./opt/vc/LICENCE for licencing terms
